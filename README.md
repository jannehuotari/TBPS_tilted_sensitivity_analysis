# TBPS_tilted_sensitivity_analysis
This Matlab code is used for calculating tolerance sensitivities in the CMS Tracker TBPS tilted section.
Functionality for calculating various tolerance scenarios is also included.

CERN_detectors.m is the main file from which the simulations are run from. I tried to include extensive comments embedded
into the code to guide the user.
